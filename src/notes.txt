you can check out how i'm adding the classes in 
constellation and keyword
like appending className
you wont be able to do it with just css

because there will be 3 distinct states


1. nothing is hovered (default)
2. something is hovered and it is related (highlight)
3. something is hovered and it is not related (greyed out)



so i have a ternary right now


you'll need to add a 'isKeywordHovered' and 'isArtworkHovered' 
to the redux state and toggle that on and off on the mouseOver 
and mouseOut redux actions
