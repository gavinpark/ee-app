            "Part exhibition framework experimentation, part interface design interrogation, Establishing a Database Connection investigates how the digital file database of the Leonard & Bina Ellen (LBE) Art Gallery’s collection can be activated beyond the pure intention of data preservation and storage. As the inaugural project of the Expanding Exhibitions residency series, its premise is to introduce a digital counterpart to the methods explored in the 2009 LBE Gallery exhibition As much as possible given the time and space allotted (AMAP). In this exhibition, curators Rebecca Duclos and David K. Ross explored ways “to systematically remove as many artworks as possible from the LBE Gallery storage vault and … [be] sequentially installed in the exhibition area using all spaces available.”[1] Ten years later, this new project critically reconsiders how this type of performative gesture can be enacted through the LBE Gallery’s digitized collection database. With an unexpected interface design stripped of conventional methods of search and navigation, Establishing a Database Connection enables you to build spatial, relational constellations or lattices of connections between artworks in the LBE Gallery’s collection. These networks become a reflection on the narratives that can emerge or are implied, or on those that are missing — ultimately affecting one’s perception of, or connection to, the collection as a whole.",
            "This project’s research methodology extends that of AMAP in that it considers what performative and systematic curatorial methodologies (rather than typical museological models) can reveal about the LBE Gallery’s collection, as well as how these dynamic systems create chance juxtapositions between works.[2]  Establishing a Database Connection frames its expansion of themes presented in AMAP by drawing on media theory and contemporary museological critique with particular attention to recent critical scholarship on the politics of algorithmic organization as it relates to the broader digital condition, but also, more importantly, to what it might mean for the circulation of data related to collection artworks, their materiality, and the gallery/museum’s relationship with digitization and virtuality.",
            "The design of this interface intends to subvert conventional methods of online navigation and search habits by removing graphical elements, or barriers, associated with accessing knowledge and information gatekeeping (i.e., search boxes, toolbars, menus). This aspect of the project draws on recent scholarship that considers serendipitous interface design, user experience, and the habitualization and defamiliarization of how one engages with online platforms. As an alternative to traditional compartmentalized and linear interface design, non-linear navigation has the potential to build an information space that prompts serendipitous connections, aleatory juxtapositions, and flâneur(se)-like fluidity to emerge among the artworks present in the LBE Gallery collection. To facilitate this, the design of the interface is pliable, responding and reacting to your actions; directional, creating pathways among your connections; and generous, offering plentiful and unexpected results."

        essayHeader: "Database and Narrative",
        essayText: [
            "In the most general sense, the database is defined as a structured collection of data,[3]  often one that not only organizes the information it holds, but also has the ability to be queried and extracted from. If we think of the database in these terms and in the context of a cultural institution like the LBE Art Gallery, how can we subvert or appropriate this system of organization, retrieval, and display to construct chance-based narratives and new connections between artworks?",
            "The “data” that is referred to in the context of this project consists of but is not limited to information associated with each physical object in the gallery’s collection, such as the artist’s name, artwork title, year, acquisition number, medium, or description. In the broader context of the cultural institution, the database functions primarily as an administrative tool of collection management allowing for the organization and quick retrieval of this data. Typical online cultural collection databases use automatic filters that return results which favour popular works and relegate less-known works to the “bottom of the pile.” Alternatively, this project employs a faceted search method, grouping artworks based on tags that have been extracted and parsed from the “keyword” and “subject” database fields. These fields represent subjective interpretations of each artwork by the gallery’s curators, past and present. Just as AMAP allowed for “a series of unbiased selections to inspire an unconventional connoisseurship that highlights process over pedigree,” Establishing a Database Connection looks to shift the agency from the predetermined algorithm to you, the visitor, who can make associations and build a narrative by navigating through the database in a serendipitous, open format. [4]",
            "The relationship between the database as a cultural form and the production of narrative is one that was originally raised by media theorist Lev Manovich in his 1999 text Database as Symbolic Form, wherein he argued that while “a database can support narrative” (i.e., while it can provide a structure for information to be built into a narrative), “there is nothing in the logic of the medium itself which would foster its generation.”[5]  This is to say that the database, in its essence, is concerned only with the efficient searching and retrieval of information, and cannot facilitate, in this context, the same role as the gallery or museum, which contributes to the contextualization or display of its collected objects. On this subject, critic Mike Pepi reminds us in his 2014 essay Is the Museum a Database? that “we cannot seek data in the museum the way we look for it in the database”; that is to say, the database is not designed to produce meaning or contextualize holdings for those who interact with it.[6]    However, the database can set the stage for narrative to be established, and, as Pepi adds in his 2019 revisitation of the above essay, titled Is the Database a Museum?, that “narrative is the missing link, be it provided by a curator or an algorithm.”[7]  Establishing a Database Connection seeks to explore this relationship between database structures, the LBE Art Gallery collection, and the generation of narrative therein."

        essayHeader: "Activating the Database",
        essayText: [
            "When visiting online databases (and websites in general), as users we expect to see familiar navigation elements such as a menu, search bar, or filter settings that can help orient and guide us — but what happens when these items are displaced, concealed, or removed entirely? Establishing a Database Connection experiments with the method of defamiliarization as a means to subvert traditional online collection database exploration and to consider how familiar systems of navigation might create merely an illusion of access and choice. Defamiliarization is effectively the antithesis of habitualization — which, according to Russian formalist poet Victor Shklovsky in his seminal 1917 essay “Art as Technique,” is a perception of the world that is “unconsciously automatic,” uncritical, and passive.[8]  The goal of defamiliarization in approaching design, however, is not to produce the most efficient or streamlined arrangements, but to prompt an active spectatorship among those who engage with such an interface.[9]  By prompting a creative and curious search procedure, Establishing a Database Connection aims to challenge subconscious behaviours and provoke an inquiry into both the collection holdings and the system which enables us to access them.[10]",
            "When elements like search bars or filters are intentionally removed, database objects can reveal themselves through interconnected manual searching and gathering actions performed by the searcher. In basic search mechanisms, oversimplified connections are often made with the intention solely to aggregate or accumulate information. Art historian David Joselit notes that this is reflective of contemporary data mining practices, where the collection of information functions as an accumulation of capital whose value is determined by the patterns it generates.[11]  This project asks, therefore, how data is valued in the context of the LBE Art Gallery collection database, and how it may be activated in order to promote new, unusual, and serendipitous connections among the collection’s holdings. It is the hope of this project that unexpected connections between artworks in the gallery’s collection will take place, and that such connections may create space for you, the user, to have greater agency and remain in possession of your own rationalizations. Like AMAP, the probability of a matrix of possible outcomes remains the objective, rather than consuming something that has been predetermined, pre-aggregated, and neatly compiled."

            "This project seeks to raise many questions regarding the clusters of relations that can emerge through the digitized representations of the LBE Art Gallery’s collection. What is lost or gained through such relations or interactions? How does one activate a digital database of collection data — an often fragmented, static, and private repository — as a dynamic, networked, and potentially unlimited representation of the collection for the public?",
            "Navigating by way of intuition or intrigue, your selection is released to float within an open plane, ultimately allowing for a sort of “digital wandering” along interconnected, nonlinear pathways through the gallery’s collection database. These pathways, mapped and displayed according to your own subjective interests, form lattices of connections among works in the collection based on the language that is associated with each work as it appears in the database. As this action is repeated, an algorithm within the database panel simultaneously recommends new works according to your last selection. Through this kind of navigation, Establishing a Database Connection encourages its visitors to shape unexpected constellations based on their own interests and goals, yet are ultimately led by the language inputted and maintained by the collection’s curators and administrators.",
            "The semantic clustering of digital objects in order to draw links among physical ones housed in collections allows for what is defined as a quality of connectedness. This way of navigating through constellations of data demands information access systems that transcend traditional systems of information organization and classification in order to evoke new experiences and provide meaningful contextualization for works of art.[12] ",

        essayText: [
            "What does it mean to draw connections between digital objects that represent physical ones? Each physical object in the collection is represented within the interface either by its photographic documentation or an associated description existing in the database. It is generally believed that photographic or other surrogate documentation represents a limited way to experience a work, as it does not reproduce its material qualities or presence. However, in digitizing the collection, such digital surrogates become entirely new objects in and of themselves. Although these digital objects are not meant to act as replacements for the physical one in the collection, their documentary value and the data they are composed of should be considered significant.[13]  The librarian Jasmine Burns has termed this concept “virtuality,” in which digital surrogates should be viewed as individual objects separate from their physical counterparts.[14]  By understanding these objects in this way, Burns adds that “the surrogate draws its significance from the ongoing narrative of its physical counterpart and serves as a mediator between the viewer of the surrogate and the creator of the original work.”[15]  In the translation of the physical gallery holdings into metadata and digitized files, their materiality is not lost and becomes, instead, an augmented version of its physical twin: an extension of the original with a quality and materiality of its own."

        essayText: [
            "As this project interfaces with the LBE Art Gallery’s collection database, it seeks to present, in the same spirit as AMAP, a self-curating or outwardly unmediated presentation of the collection that welcomes limitations, inefficiency, and human error. Establishing a Database Connection mirrors this embrace of such obstacles and considers additionally how the associated information that is kept within the gallery’s database might highlight notions of efficiency, access, and visibility.",
            "The LBE Art Gallery’s collection database, generally, is not entirely available for public use; most details are accessible only by the gallery staff.[16]  While anyone may request to access the database for research purposes, its value as a resource is partly based on whether or not an individual already knows what they are looking for. To interface internally with the collection database, for example, demands prerequisite knowledge of how to use that specific collections management software. Thus, the collection database may be what is termed a “dark archive” — an archive that grants but limited public access and serves chiefly to preserve the information it contains.[17]  Establishing a Database Connection seeks to embrace and critique such limitations as they present themselves and, as a result, to ask: what are the limitations that prevent this dark archive from being accessible?",
            "Within this project, works are linked through an algorithm-like operation that creates connections between selections of curator-imputed language, experimenting with both empirical and conceptual systems of organization so that one may produce and explore dynamic connecting pathways within the collection database. This, however, also may suggest a critique of digital labour, so often overlooked or unaccounted for in the process of building such databases. By accepting and making visible such limitations within the interface, this project seeks to develop a dialogue around the variability of human versus machine efficiency, the visibility of systems, and the fragile nature of digitized files — especially in the context of gallery archives or databases, which are often fragmented and in flux, and the product of endless digital labour.",

            "AMAP sought to counteract the enduring belief that galleries and museums refuse to share their collections or to make visible such objects that might be concealed within the vault.[18]  For the curators of AMAP, the balance between the risk of presentation and the safety of preservation was one of the more compelling aspects of their institutional critique. In the case of Establishing a Database Connection, limited copyright permissions for specific artworks prevent more than half the collection from being displayed without visual documentation. This limitation places a greater emphasis on the textual descriptions of works and highlights the vulnerability of digital images, often overlooked or unnoticed in the context of the internet’s image-saturated environment. Artist and filmmaker Hito Steyerl reminds us of the risks images face when they are subjected to such arenas, wherein “works have become travelers in a digital no-man’s land, constantly shifting their resolution and format, speed and media, sometimes even losing names and credits along the way.”[19]  On this account, what does it mean for such documentary objects to become fragmented within these expansive networks, separated from their archival contexts?[20]  What additional meaning, values, or lives might these images take on under these conditions? What risk to their integrity is incurred via their circulation, displacement, or fragmentation?",

        essayText: [
            "There is a long tradition within both art history and cybernetics of considering how dynamic systems can be created or how feedback can be harnessed in order to generate critique of the control of organizational structures. In the context of the LBE Art Gallery’s collection database, as well as the dynamic web, many determining factors may delineate what is visible or invisible. These factors can be human or non-human, depending on whether content is made available through curatorial selection processes or a data organizing algorithm.[21]  In referring to such algorithms, it is becoming a common realization for many that these systems have introduced new agents of control when it comes to access and visibility.",
            "However, information gatekeeping can represent a commonality between the cultural institution and the interfaces that make up the majority of the online platforms with which we engage daily. In recent years, many galleries and museums have begun re-evaluating the types of narratives they uphold or what kinds of stories are being told over others. Alongside this shift, generally, technological solutions have often been heralded as a kind of neutral or unbiased solution to human-generated bias. However, critic Mike Pepi states that the database is wrongfully considered to be a neutral entity, as “every database contains the hidden choices and structures of its maker.”[22]  Although neither gallery/museum nor database are ever free from bias, it is the aim of Establishing a Database Connection to reveal how collection databases (or databases in general) and organizing algorithms are better at concealing these biases, creating false impressions of independent choice and free access to information.",
            "Typical online gallery collection databases are navigable via organizing or recommendation systems, enforcing a combination of institutional gatekeeping and machine bias enabled by streamlining algorithms. Therefore, what information may be considered valuable, and what information is simply secondary (or perhaps dispensable) within a collection database? How can we engage with digital collection archives and databases in nuanced, unpredictable ways that embrace inefficiency, human error, and the transparency of their contents? More importantly, how can curatorial guidance and activation reassert agency within this context?",
            "Just as a curator sets a collection in motion by mediating, establishing context, and interpreting the works in the gallery’s physical holdings, in this context the curatorial hand is passive and is represented through the subjective language used to describe and contextualize each database object. Within the database, keywords have been assigned by the database’s various administrators and parsed as tags as a method of organizing and creating connections among objects. Although these tags have been produced by the curators, and not the database user, the visitor is not passive. Instead, you are encouraged to be critical of the word choices and language embedded alongside these works. Within this interface, keywords will appear as you select each new work, and become part of your constellation of information. As you traverse the interface, actions such as hovering or clicking will highlight other artworks associated with a particular keyword, and vice versa. From here, we encourage you to question the associations that are being automatically generated.",

            "Since the gallery’s establishment in 1966, its commitment to its associated university community, as well as to the collection of contemporary Québécois and Canadian artwork, has been its priority and focus. Although the Gallery’s collection represents various movements and styles that have shaped Canadian art history, the majority of its approximately 1,800 works date from the latter half of the twentieth century. Over the course of its collecting history, the LBE Art Gallery has presented a non-narrative acquisition history, with gaps and inconsistencies. Such inconsistencies may be attributed, for example, to the inclusion of decorative objects sourced from flea markets, the accession of non-Canadian or ethnographic objects, or the loss, theft, or misplacement of artworks due to inadequate conservation protocols.",
            "Materially, the collection is characterized mostly by works on paper, but it also contains paintings, prints, photographs, videos, sculptures, and more. The Gallery’s current collecting practices are the result of a seven-year moratorium set in place between 2003 and 2010 by its current director. During this time, acquisition policies were reconsidered in light of this disparate collecting history and redrafted in the aim of tightening the parameters of the Gallery’s collecting practices the more closely to reflect its programming. As well, over the last ten years, the Gallery has outlined its commitment to the decolonization and indigenization of academic and cultural institutions, as well as to acquiring, on a regular basis, works by Indigenous artists.[23]",
            "In the same spirit, this residency project explores the non-linear pathways inherent in the LBE Art Gallery’s collecting history. Encouraging oblique relationships to emerge between works may thus become a means to better reflect the gallery’s current mandate, which is centred around research, experimentation, and critical inquiry."
