        essayText: "Part exhibition framework experimentation, part interface design interrogation, Establishing a Database Connection investigates how the digital file database of the Leonard & Bina Ellen (LBE) Art Gallery’s collection can be activated beyond the pure intention of data preservation and storage.  As the inaugural project of the Expanding Exhibitions residency series, its premise is to introduce a digital counterpart to the methods explored in the 2009 LBE exhibition As Much As Possible Given The Time And Space Allotted (AMAP). In this exhibition, curators Rebecca Duclos and David K. Ross explored ways “to systematically remove as many artworks as possible from the LBE Gallery storage vault and [...] [be] sequentially installed in the exhibition area using all spaces available.”[1]   Ten years after AMAP took place, this project critically reconsiders how this type of performative gesture can be enacted through the LBE Gallery’s digitized collection database. With an unexpected interface design stripped of conventional methods of search and navigation, Establishing a Database Connection enables you to build spatial, relational constellations or lattices of connections between LBE collection artworks. These networks become a reflection on the narratives that can emerge, are implied, or the ones which are missing – ultimately affecting one’s perception of, or connection to, the collection as a whole. This project’s research methodology extends that of AMAP in that it considers what performative and systematic curatorial methodologies (rather than typical museological models) can reveal about the LBE Art Gallery collection, as well as how these dynamic systems create chance juxtapositions between works.[2]  Establishing a Database Connections frames its expansion of themes presented in AMAP by drawing on media theory and contemporary museological critique with particular attention to recent critical scholarship on the politics of algorithmic organization as it relates to both the broader digital condition, but more importantly what it might mean for the circulation of data related to collection artworks, their materiality and the gallery/museum’s relationship with digitization and virtuality. The design of this interface intends to subvert conventional methods of online navigation and search habits by removing graphical elements, or barriers, associated with accessing knowledge and information gatekeeping (i.e.: search boxes, toolbars, menus). This aspect of the project draws on recent scholarship that considers serendipitous interface design, user experience, and the habitualization and defamiliarization of how one engages with online platforms. As an alternative to traditional compartmentalized and linear interface design, non-linear navigation has the potential to build an information space that prompts serendipitous connections, aleatory juxtapositions and flâneur(se)-like fluidity to emerge amongst the artworks present in the LBE Art Gallery collection. To facilitate this, the design of the interface is pliable - responding and reacting to your actions, directional - creating a pathway of your connections and generous - offering plentiful and unexpected results.",

        essayHeader: "Database and Narrative",
        essayText: "In the most general sense, the database is defined as a structured collection of data, often one that not only organizes the information it holds, but also has the ability to be queried and extracted from. If we think of the database in these terms and in the context of a cultural institution like the LBE Art Gallery, how can we subvert or appropriate this system of organization, retrieval and display to construct chance-based narratives and new connections between artworks? The “data” that is referred to in the context of this project, consists of, but is not limited to, information associated with each physical object in the LBE Art Gallery collection such as an artist’s name, artwork title, year, acquisition number, medium or description. The database, in the broader context of the cultural institution, primarily functions as an administrative tool of collection management allowing for the organization and quick retrieval of this data within the collection holdings. Typical online cultural collection databases use automatic filters that return results which favour popular works and relegate lesser known works to the “bottom of the pile.” Alternatively, this project employs a faceted search method, grouping artworks based on tags that have been extracted and parsed from the “keyword” and “subject” fields of the database. These fields are subjective interpretations of each artwork by the gallery’s past and present curators. Just as AMAP allowed for “a series of unbiased selections to inspire an unconventional connoisseurship that highlights process over pedigree,” Establishing a Database Connection looks to shift the agency from the predetermined algorithm to you, the visitor, who can make associations and build a narrative by navigating through the database in a serendipitous and open format. The relationship between the database as a cultural form and the production of narrative is one that was originally raised by media theorist Lev Manovich in his 1999 text Database as Symbolic Form where he argued that while “a database can support narrative,” (ie: it can provide a structure for information to be built into a narrative) “there is nothing in the logic of the medium itself which would foster its generation.” This is to say that the database, in its essence, is concerned only with the efficient searching and retrieval of information, and cannot facilitate, in this context, the same role as the gallery or museum, which contributes to the contextualization or display of its collected objects. On this subject, critic Mike Pepi reminds us in his 2014 essay Is the Museum a Database? that “we cannot seek data in the museum the way we look for it in the database,” meaning, the database is not designed to produce meaning or contextualize holdings for those who interact with it. However, the database can set the stage for narrative to be established, and, as Pepi adds in his revisited 2019 version of Is the Museum a Database, titled, Is the Database a Museum, that “narrative is the missing link, be it provided by a curator or an algorithm.” Establishing a Database Connection seeks to explore this relationship between database structures, the LBE Art Gallery collection and the generation of narrative therewithin.

        essayHeader: "Activating the Database",
        essayText: "When visiting online databases (and websites in general), as users we expect to see familiar navigation elements such as a menu, search bar or filter settings that can help to orient and guide, but what happens when these items are displaced, concealed, or removed entirely? Establishing a Database Connection experiments with the method of defamiliarization as a means to subvert traditional online collections database exploration and to consider how familiar systems of navigation might create the illusion of access and choice. Defamiliarization is effectively the antithesis of habitualization — which, according to Russian formalist poet Victor Shklovsky in his seminal 1917 essay Art as Technique, is a perception of the world that is “unconsciously automatic,” uncritical and passive. The goal of defamiliarization when it comes to approaching design, however, is not to produce the most efficient or streamlined arrangements, but to prompt an active spectatorship amongst those who engage with such an interface. By prompting a creative and curious search procedure, Establishing a Database Connection aims to challenge subconscious behaviour and provoke an inquiry of both the collection holdings and the system which enables us to access them. By intentionally removing elements like a search bar or filter, database objects reveal themselves through interconnected manual searching and gathering actions that you perform. In basic search mechanisms, oversimplified connections are made often with the only intention to aggregate or accumulate information. Art historian David Joselit notes that this is reflective of such contemporary practices of data mining, where information collection functions as an accumulation of capital whose value is determined by the patterns it generates. This project asks, therefore, how data is valued in the context of the LBE Art Gallery collection database, and how it can be activated in order to promote new, unusual and serendipitous connections amongst collection holdings. It is the hope of this project that unexpected connections between artworks in the LBE Art Gallery collection will take place, and that it can create space for youto have agency and remain in possession of your own rationalizations. Like AMAP, the probability of a matrix of possible outcomes remains the objective, rather than consuming something that has been predetermined, pre-aggregated, and neatly compiled.",

        essayHeader: "Constellations",
        essayText: "This project seeks to raise many questions regarding the clusters of relations that can emerge through the digitized representations of the LBE Art Gallery collection. What is lost or gained through this kind of interaction? How does one activate a digital database of collection data — an often fragmented, static, and private repository — as a dynamic, networked, and potentially unlimited representation of the collection for the public? Navigating by way of intuition or intrigue, your selection is released to float within an open plane, ultimately allowing for a digital wandering within the LBE Art Gallery collection database along interconnected and nonlinear pathways. These pathways, as they are mapped and displayed according to your own subjective interests, form lattices of connections amongst works in the collection based on the language that is associated with each of them as it appears in the database. As this action is repeated, new works are simultaneously recommended by an algorithm within the database panel according to your last selection.  Through this kind of navigation, Establishing a Database Connection encourages its visitors to shape unexpected constellations based on their own sense of intrigue, yet are ultimately led by the language inputted and maintained by the collection’s curators and administrators. The semantic clustering of digital objects in order to draw links amongst physical ones in collections allows for what is defined as a quality of connectedness. This way of navigating through constellations of data advocates for information access systems that transcend traditional systems of information organization and classification in order to evoke new experiences and provide meaningful contextualization to works of art.

        essayHeader: "Digital Objects",
        essayText: "What does it mean to draw connections between digital objects that represent physical ones? Each physical object in the collection is represented within the interface by either its photographic documentation or associated description as it appears in the database. It is generally believed that photographic or other surrogate documentation represents a limited way to experience a work, as it does not reproduce its material qualities or presence. However, in digitizing the collection, its digital surrogates become entirely new objects in themselves. Although these digital objects are not meant to act as replacements of the physical objects within the collection, their documentary value and the data they are composed of should be considered significant. This concept has been termed by librarian Jasmine Burns as “virtuality,” where digital surrogates should be viewed as individual objects separate from their physical counterparts. By understanding these objects in this way, Burns adds that “the surrogate draws its significance from the ongoing narrative of its physical counterpart and serves as a mediator between the viewer of the surrogate and the creator of the original work.” Through the translation of the physical gallery holdings into metadata and digitized files, their materiality is not lost, and instead becomes an augmented version of its physical twin: an extension of the original with a quality and materiality of its own.",

        essayHeader: "Limitations, Visibility and Access",
        essayText: "As this project interfaces with the database of the LBE Art Gallery collection, in the same spirit as AMAP it seeks to present a self-curating or outwardly unmediated presentation of the collection that welcomes limitations, inefficiency and human error. Establishing a Database Connection mirrors this embrace of such obstacles and considers additionally how the associated information that is kept within the gallery’s database might highlight notions of efficiency, access and visibility. The LBE Art Gallery collection database, generally, is not entirely available for public use, where most details are accessible only by the gallery staff. While anyone can request to access the database for research purposes, its value as a resource is partly based on whether or not an individual already knows what they are looking for. For example, the technology currently used to interface internally with the collection database requires a prerequisite knowledge of how to use specific collections management software in order to use it. In turn, the collection database can be what is considered a “dark archive:” an archive that grants limited public access and only preserves the information it contains. Establishing a Database Connection seeks to embrace and critique the limitations that have presented themselves and as a result, asks: what are the limitations that prevent this dark archive from being accessible?  Within this project, works are linked through an algorithm-like operation that connects curator-imputed language, experimenting with both empirical and conceptual systems of organization so that one may produce dynamic connecting pathways within the collection database. This, however, also may serve as a critique of the digital labour that is often overlooked or unaccounted for when considering the building of these databases.  Through accepting and making visible such limitations within the interface, this project seeks to develop a dialogue around the variability of human versus machine efficiency, the visibility of systems, and the fragile nature of digitized files, especially within the context of gallery archives or databases – which are often fragmented, in flux, and an endless source of digital labour.",

        essayHeader: "Copyright",
        essayText: "AMAP sought to counteract the enduring belief that galleries and museums refuse to share their collections, and to make visible objects that might be concealed within the vault. For the curators of AMAP, the balance between the risk of presentation and the safety of preservation was considered to be one of the more compelling aspects of their institutional critique. In the case of Establishing a Database Connection, limited copyright permissions of specific artworks renders over half of the collection to be displayed without visual documentation. This limitation places a greater emphasis on the textual description of the work and highlights the vulnerability of digital images that is often overlooked or unnoticed within the image-saturated environment of the internet. Artist and filmmaker Hito Steyerl reminds us of the risks images face when they are subjected to such arenas, where “works have become travelers in a digital no-man’s land, constantly shifting their resolution and format, speed and media, sometimes even losing names and credits along the way.” On this account, what does it mean for such documentation to become fragmented within these expansive networks, separated from their archival contexts? What additional meaning, values or lives might they take on in these conditions, or, what risk to their integrity is taken by their circulation, displacement or fragmentation?",

        essayHeader: "Classification Systems and Bias",
        essayText: "There is a long tradition within both art history and cybernetics of considering how dynamic systems can be created or how feedback can be harnessed in order to generate critique of the control of organizational structures. In the context of the LBE Art Gallery collection database, as well as the dynamic web, there are many determining factors that might limit what is visible or invisible. These factors can be human or non-human, whether content is made available by curatorial selection processes or that of a data organizing algorithm. When referring to such algorithms, it is becoming a common realization amongst many that these systems have introduced a new agent of control when it comes to access and visibility. However, information gatekeeping can be a commonality between the cultural institution and the interfaces that make up the majority of the online platforms many engage with daily. In recent years, many galleries and museums have begun re-evaluating the types of narratives they uphold or what kind of stories are being told over others. Alongside this shift, generally, technological solutions have often been heralded as a kind of neutral or unbiased solution to human-generated bias. However, critic Mike Pepi states that the database is wrongfully considered to be a neutral entity, as “every database contains the hidden choices and structures of its maker.” Although both gallery/museum and database are not ever free from bias, it is the intention of Establishing a Database Connection to reveal that collection databases (or databases in general) and organizing algorithms are better at concealing these biases, creating false impressions of independent choice and free access to information. Typical online gallery collection databases are navigable by organizing or recommendation systems, enforcing a combination of institutional gatekeeping and machine bias enabled by streamlining algorithms. Therefore, what is considered valuable and what is simply considered secondary (or perhaps dispensable) information within a collection database? How can we engage with digital collection archives and databases in nuanced, and unpredictable ways that embrace inefficiency, human error, and transparency of their contents? More importantly, how can curatorial guidance and activation reassert agency within this context? Just as a curator sets a collection in motion by mediating, establishing context and interpreting the works in the physical gallery’s holdings, in this context,the curatorial hand is passive, and is represented through the subjective language that is used to describe and contextualize each database object. Within the database, keywords have been assigned by the database’s various administrators and parsed as tags as a method of organizing and creating connections amongst objects.  Although these tags have been produced by curators and are not applied by those interfacing with the database objects, the visitor is not passive. Instead, you are encouraged to be critical of word choice and language embedded alongside these works. Within the interface, keywords will display and become part of your constellation upon each selection of a new work. As you traverse this interface, actions such as hovering or clicking will highlight artworks associated with the given keyword and vice-versa. From here, we encourage you to question the associations that are being automatically generated.",

Its aim is to produce a digital project mining the gallery’s exhibition and curatorial histories in order to develop a parallel, augmented, or counter digital narrative on a specific exhibition (or more).  Its outcome is to examine new exhibition frameworks and to engage far-reaching and diverse audiences through a networked digital platform. Specific concepts that have been pulled from AMAP include, but are not limited to: a non-narrative and systematic curatorial methodology, a critique of hierarchies, private/public access within exhibition spaces/institutions, risk and the balancing of preservation and presentation, performative displays, and adapting or submitting to limitations, inefficiency and error.

        essayText: "Since the gallery’s establishment in 1966, its commitment to its associated university community, as well as to the collection of contemporary Quebecois and Canadian artwork has been its priority and focus. Although the LBE Art Gallery collection represents various movements and styles that have shaped Canadian art history, the majority of roughly 1,800 works are dated from the last half of the 20th century. Over the course of its collecting history, the LBE Art Gallery presents a non-narrative acquisition history with gaps and inconsistencies. For example, such inconsistencies can be attributed to the inclusion of decorative objects sourced from flea markets, the accession of non-Canadian or ethnographic objects, or the loss, theft or misplacement of artworks due to inadequate conservational protocols. The collection is characterized materially by mostly works on paper, but also contains paintings, prints, photography, video, sculpture, and more. Currently, collecting practices are a result of an seven-year moratorium that was set in place between 2003 and 2010 by the gallery’s current director. During this time, acquisition policies were redrafted in consideration of this disparate collecting history, and were redrafted in view of tightening the parameters of the Gallery’s collecting practices so they reflect more closely its programming. As well, in the last 10 years the Gallery has outlined its own commitments to the decolonization and indigenization of academic and cultural institutions as well as to acquiring on a regular basis works by indigenous artists. In the same spirit, this web performance explores the non-linear pathways inherent within the LBE Art Gallery’s collecting history.  By encouraging oblique relationships to emerge between works as a way to reflect the gallery’s current mandate which is centred around research, experimentation and critical inquiry.",
